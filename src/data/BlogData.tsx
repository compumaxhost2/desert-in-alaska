        <p>If you own or manage a commercial property in Detroit, MI, you may eventually find yourself asking a simple but important question: <Link href="/services/commercial-hvac-detroit" className="text-[#8b5428] hover:underline"><strong>Who provides commercial HVAC services in Detroit, MI?</strong></Link></p>
        <p>The answer depends on what your building needs.</p>
        <p>Commercial HVAC is much more than installing an air conditioner or replacing a furnace. Businesses depend on properly designed heating, cooling, ventilation, and air distribution systems to keep employees comfortable, protect equipment, maintain indoor air quality, and keep daily operations moving.</p>
        <p>A commercial HVAC contractor works with businesses, restaurants, warehouses, industrial facilities, offices, retail properties, and other commercial buildings to install, repair, maintain, upgrade, and replace HVAC equipment.</p>
        <p>In Detroit, these systems have to deal with significant seasonal changes. A commercial property may need dependable heating during freezing winter conditions and effective cooling and ventilation during hot and humid summer weather.</p>
        <p>That is where an experienced local contractor can make a difference.</p>
        <p><Link href="/" className="text-[#8b5428] hover:underline"><strong>Desert In Alaska Corp</strong></Link> provides commercial HVAC installation, repair, maintenance, heating, cooling, ventilation, and HVAC upgrade services for businesses and commercial properties throughout Metro Detroit.</p>

          <>
            <p>A <strong>commercial HVAC contractor</strong> specializes in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems designed for business and industrial environments.</p>
            <p>Residential HVAC systems are generally designed around individual homes or smaller spaces. Commercial systems can be considerably more complex because they may need to serve large buildings, multiple zones, production areas, restaurants, warehouses, offices, or other specialized environments.</p>
            <p>A commercial HVAC contractor can handle services such as:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1"><li>Commercial HVAC installation</li><li>HVAC equipment replacement</li><li>Commercial HVAC repairs</li><li>Preventive maintenance</li><li>Heating system services</li><li>Commercial air conditioning repair</li><li>Ventilation installation</li><li>HVAC system upgrades</li><li>Rooftop HVAC unit service</li><li>Make-up air systems</li><li>Industrial HVAC equipment</li></ul>
            <p>The right contractor begins by understanding the building, its use, existing equipment, operating requirements, and comfort needs before recommending a solution.</p>
            <p>For businesses, that planning matters. An HVAC system that is too small may struggle to maintain comfortable temperatures. A system that is oversized or poorly configured can create unnecessary operating costs and inconsistent indoor conditions.</p>

            <p>Commercial HVAC requirements vary considerably from one building to another.</p>
            <p>A small retail property may need a rooftop unit repaired. A restaurant may need ventilation and make-up air equipment coordinated with its heating and cooling system. A warehouse may require industrial HVAC equipment capable of handling a large open space.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the major commercial HVAC services businesses may need.</p>
            <p className="font-semibold">Commercial HVAC Installation</p><p>Installing a new HVAC system requires more than placing equipment on a roof or inside a mechanical room.</p><p>The contractor needs to consider building size, occupancy, heating and cooling requirements, ventilation, equipment location, ductwork, controls, electrical requirements, and other project conditions.</p><p>Professional installation can help ensure the system is properly configured and commissioned for the building.</p><p>Desert In Alaska Corp provides commercial HVAC installation services for new construction, replacements, and commercial upgrades.</p>
            <p className="font-semibold">Commercial HVAC Repair</p><p>Unexpected HVAC problems can interfere with business operations.</p><p>A heating failure during winter can make a commercial building uncomfortable. An air conditioning problem during summer can affect employees, customers, inventory, and equipment.</p><p>Commercial HVAC repair may involve diagnosing problems with equipment, controls, airflow, heating components, cooling components, ventilation equipment, or other parts of the system.</p><p>Fast diagnosis is especially important when a malfunction affects a large facility.</p>
            <p className="font-semibold">Preventive HVAC Maintenance</p><p>Waiting until an HVAC system fails can create unnecessary disruption.</p><p>Preventive maintenance gives businesses an opportunity to identify developing problems before they become major equipment failures.</p><p>A maintenance program may include inspections, cleaning, operational checks, equipment adjustments, and identification of worn or failing components.</p><p>Regular maintenance can also help businesses understand the condition of their equipment and plan replacements before an emergency occurs.</p>
            <p className="font-semibold">Commercial Heating Services</p><p>Detroit businesses need dependable heating during Michigan winters.</p><p>Commercial heating services can include system inspections, repairs, equipment replacement, and maintenance.</p><p>For facilities that depend on consistent temperatures, heating problems can become an operational issue rather than simply a comfort problem.</p>
            <p className="font-semibold">Commercial Cooling Services</p><p>Commercial air conditioning systems have to handle summer heat while maintaining comfortable indoor conditions.</p><p>A commercial HVAC contractor can inspect cooling equipment, diagnose performance problems, perform repairs, and install replacement systems when existing equipment reaches the end of its useful service life.</p>
            <p className="font-semibold">Commercial Ventilation</p><p>Ventilation is another important part of commercial HVAC.</p><p>Proper ventilation helps move air through a building while supporting indoor environmental conditions.</p><p>Restaurants, manufacturing facilities, warehouses, offices, and other commercial properties can have different ventilation requirements depending on how the building is used.</p><p>A contractor can evaluate the existing ventilation setup and determine whether repairs, upgrades, or new equipment are necessary.</p>

          Industrial facilities depend on reliable fire protection systems to safeguard employees, equipment, inventory, and business operations. In a busy industrial city like <strong>Detroit, MI</strong>, manufacturing plants, warehouses, processing facilities, commercial kitchens, automotive operations, and other industrial properties face unique fire risks every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fire suppression system is designed to respond quickly when a fire occurs. However, like any mechanical or safety-critical system, it requires regular inspection, maintenance, and professional servicing. Ignoring warning signs can leave your facility vulnerable when protection is needed most.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is that many business owners and facility managers do not realize their <Link href="/services/commercial-fire-suppression-detroit" className="text-[#1915de] hover:underline">industrial fire suppression system needs service</Link> until they experience a malfunction, inspection failure, or potentially dangerous incident.

              One of the clearest signs that your industrial fire suppression system needs immediate attention is <strong>visible physical damage</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Facility managers should periodically inspect accessible components for obvious problems.

            <p>
              For example, corrosion may gradually weaken a component. A damaged nozzle may prevent the suppression agent from being distributed correctly. A leaking connection may reduce system pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Industrial environments can be particularly demanding. Exposure to moisture, heat, chemicals, dust, vibration, and machinery can contribute to component deterioration.

          Detroit is known for its changing weather conditions. Businesses in
          the city can experience hot and humid summers, freezing winters, heavy
          snowfall, strong winds, rain, and rapid temperature changes throughout
          the year. These conditions do more than affect people heading to work.
          They also put considerable pressure on commercial heating and cooling
          equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For commercial buildings, maintaining a comfortable indoor environment
          is not simply about keeping employees comfortable. HVAC systems help
          protect equipment, maintain air quality, control humidity, preserve
          inventory, and support daily operations. When a commercial HVAC system
          is not prepared for Detroit&apos;s climate, extreme weather can
          increase energy consumption, accelerate equipment wear, and contribute
          to unexpected breakdowns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding the relationship between   <Link href="https://www.desertinalaska.com/services/commercial-hvac-detroit" className="text-[#8b5428] hover:underline">Detroit weather and commercial HVAC systems</Link> can help business owners and facility managers make
          better maintenance decisions. Seasonal inspections, timely repairs,
          proper system sizing, and professional HVAC service can all help a
          commercial system perform more reliably throughout the year.

              Commercial HVAC equipment in Detroit has to handle two very
              different extremes.
            </p>
            <p>
              During summer, air conditioning systems may operate for long
              periods as outdoor temperatures rise. High humidity can make
              indoor spaces feel warmer and place additional demand on cooling
              equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Winter presents an entirely different challenge. Heating systems
              may run continuously during periods of freezing temperatures.
              Snow, ice, wind, and extremely cold outdoor conditions can affect
              heating equipment, ventilation systems, rooftop units, and other
              components.
            </p>
            <p>
              The transition between seasons can also be demanding. A building
              may require heating in the morning and cooling later in the day.
              This constant adjustment can increase the workload on HVAC
              equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this reason, <Link href="https://www.desertinalaska.com/services/commercial-hvac-detroit" className="text-[#8b5428] hover:underline"> commercial HVAC maintenance in Detroit</Link> should
              account for seasonal weather rather than treating HVAC service as
              an occasional repair task.

            <p>
              Winter is one of the most demanding seasons for commercial heating
              equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
              When outdoor temperatures drop significantly, heating systems must
              work harder to maintain the temperature selected by building
              occupants. Furnaces, boilers, heat pumps, rooftop heating units,
              and other systems can experience extended operating cycles.
            </p>
            <p>
              If equipment is already suffering from worn components or
              restricted airflow, winter conditions can expose those problems
              quickly.

          <>
            <p>
              Cold weather naturally increases the amount of work required from
              a heating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              A commercial building loses heat through doors, windows, walls,
              roofs, and other openings. The colder it is outside, the greater
              the difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures. HVAC
              equipment must compensate for that heat loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the system is poorly maintained, it may run longer than
              necessary. This can increase energy consumption and place
              additional stress on motors, electrical components, heat
              exchangers, belts, and other parts.

            <p>
              Commercial buildings with boilers, hydronic heating systems,
              cooling towers, or water lines may face freezing risks if
              vulnerable areas are not adequately protected. Frozen water can
              expand and potentially damage pipes and connected components.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proper insulation, monitoring, and preventative maintenance are
              especially important before severe winter weather arrives.

            <p>
              Many commercial buildings use rooftop HVAC units because they save
              interior space and provide efficient access for service
              technicians. However, rooftop equipment is directly exposed to
              Detroit&apos;s winter weather.
            </p>
            <p>
              Snow and ice can accumulate around equipment, vents, drains, and
              other components. Heavy accumulation may interfere with airflow or
              drainage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blocked drains can become particularly problematic. When melted
              snow or ice cannot drain properly, water may collect and
              potentially freeze again when temperatures fall.
            </p>
            <p>
              Facility managers should make sure rooftop equipment remains
              accessible and that drainage paths are kept clear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regular professional inspections can help identify winter-related
              problems before they become expensive repairs.

            <p>
              Detroit summers can bring periods of high heat and humidity.
              Commercial buildings often rely heavily on air conditioning during
              these conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cooling systems remove heat from indoor spaces and transfer it
              outside. When outdoor temperatures rise, the system may need to
              operate longer to maintain the desired indoor temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is especially challenging for large buildings with high
              occupancy levels, extensive windows, computer equipment, lighting,
              or other internal heat sources.

              During very warm weather, commercial air conditioners may run for
              extended periods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Long operating cycles are not necessarily a sign of a problem.
              However, if a system runs almost continuously without adequately
              cooling the building, there may be an underlying issue.

            <p>
              Temperature is not the only summer concern. Humidity can also
              affect commercial HVAC performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Air conditioning systems are designed to remove both heat and some
              moisture from indoor air. When outdoor humidity is high, the HVAC
              system may need to work harder to maintain a comfortable indoor
              environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Excessive indoor humidity can make a building feel uncomfortable
              even when the thermostat displays a reasonable temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
              High humidity may also contribute to condensation and
              moisture-related problems if the HVAC system is not operating
              correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              For offices, retail spaces, restaurants, warehouses, healthcare
              facilities, and other commercial properties, maintaining
              appropriate indoor humidity can be an important part of overall
              building comfort.

              Detroit weather can change quickly, particularly during
              transitional seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              A building may need heating one day and cooling shortly afterward.
              These changes can cause HVAC systems to switch operating modes more
              frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commercial HVAC equipment is designed to handle changing conditions,
              but older or poorly maintained systems may struggle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Components that have been operating near the end of their service
              life may fail when the system is placed under sudden additional
              demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is one reason seasonal maintenance is valuable. Identifying
              worn components before extreme weather arrives can reduce the
              possibility of emergency service calls.

            </p>
            <p>
              Outdoor HVAC components are exposed to wind throughout the year.

              it more difficult for the HVAC system to maintain indoor
              temperature.

              Proper airflow is essential for commercial HVAC performance in
              every season.
            </p>
            <p>
              During winter, restricted airflow can reduce heating performance
              and cause heating equipment to operate inefficiently. During summer,
              poor airflow can prevent cooled air from being distributed properly
              throughout the building.
            </p>
            <p>
              A simple problem such as a heavily clogged filter can have a
              surprisingly large effect on system performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commercial properties should follow an appropriate filter
              replacement schedule based on the building, HVAC equipment,
              occupancy, and operating conditions.

              Extreme weather can also influence commercial HVAC operating costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              When heating or cooling equipment operates for longer periods, it
              generally consumes more energy. Poor maintenance can make the
              situation worse because inefficient equipment may require additional
              runtime to achieve the same indoor temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a commercial air conditioner with dirty coils may have
              difficulty transferring heat efficiently. A heating system with
              restricted airflow may also struggle to distribute warm air
              effectively.
            </p>

              Preventative commercial HVAC maintenance can help identify

              consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
              Businesses can also benefit from programmable or smart controls

              The age and condition of an HVAC system can make a significant
              difference during severe weather.
            </p>
            <p>
              Older equipment may have less efficient components, outdated
              controls, worn motors, deteriorating electrical connections, or
              other problems.

            <p>
              That does not automatically mean an older system needs to be
              replaced. Professional inspection can help determine whether
              repair, maintenance, or replacement makes the most practical sense.

            <p>
              Commercial HVAC systems are larger and more complex than typical
              residential equipment. They may involve multiple rooftop units,
              sophisticated controls, large duct networks, boilers, ventilation
              systems, cooling equipment, and other components.
            </p>
            <p>
              Professional HVAC technicians have the tools and knowledge needed
              to diagnose these systems properly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of simply replacing a failed component, a technician can
              investigate why the component failed and determine whether another
              issue is contributing to the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach is particularly valuable when equipment is exposed
              to Detroit&apos;s changing weather conditions throughout the year.

            <p>
              Before winter, schedule a heating inspection and make sure outdoor
              equipment, drainage areas, and vulnerable components are ready for
              freezing temperatures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before summer, have the cooling system inspected and cleaned.
              Check filters, coils, condensate drains, controls, and other key
              components.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the year, monitor unusual temperature changes, energy

            </p>
            <p>
              It is also helpful to keep maintenance records. Documentation can

            </p>
            <p>
              Experience with commercial systems is important because commercial
              HVAC equipment can involve specialized controls and components.
            </p>
            <p>
              Businesses should also consider whether the contractor provides

              service provider available before an emergency occurs can make it
              easier to respond quickly when equipment problems develop.
            </p>

              Detroit&apos;s changing weather puts commercial HVAC systems to
              the test throughout the year. Freezing winter temperatures, snow,
              ice, summer heat, humidity, strong winds, and rapid seasonal
              changes can all influence HVAC performance, energy consumption,
              equipment wear, and indoor comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to reduce weather-related HVAC problems is to stay
              proactive. Regular inspections, preventative maintenance, proper
              airflow, timely repairs, and appropriate equipment selection can
              help commercial HVAC systems operate more reliably.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Detroit businesses, preparing an HVAC system before extreme
              weather arrives is far better than waiting for a breakdown in the
              middle of a freezing winter or a hot summer day. With professional
              commercial HVAC service and a consistent maintenance strategy,
              businesses can protect their equipment, improve comfort, and keep
              their operations running smoothly through every season.

            <p>
              <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Common gas piping issues include
              leaks, corrosion, damaged valves, improper pressure, aging
              infrastructure, and poorly installed connections.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Gas Leaks:</strong> Gas leaks require immediate attention.
              Warning signs may include unusual gas odors, hissing sounds, dead
              vegetation near buried lines, and unexpected increases in gas
              usage. Leak detection technicians use specialized equipment to
              identify and locate potential leaks.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Corrosion and Aging Pipes:</strong> Older piping systems
              can deteriorate over time due to corrosion, moisture exposure, and
              environmental conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Faulty Gas Valves:</strong> Gas valve replacement may be
              necessary when valves become difficult to operate or fail to
              maintain proper shutoff capability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Pressure Issues:</strong> Improper gas pressure can affect
              appliance performance, reduce efficiency, and create safety
              concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Improper Installations:</strong> Code compliant
              installations are essential because improperly sized or installed
              gas lines can cause operational problems and increase safety
              risks.

            </h3>
            <p>
              If your business repeatedly requires emergency service, the

              </summary>
              <p>
                Common signs include gas odors, rising utility bills, hissing
                sounds, equipment performance issues, and failed pressure tests.
                If you suspect a leak, stop using gas equipment and contact
                professionals immediately.

                2. How often should commercial gas piping be inspected?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Most commercial properties should schedule inspections annually.
                High-demand facilities such as restaurants, manufacturing
                plants, and industrial buildings may require more frequent
                inspections depending on equipment usage and local regulations.

            <details>
              <summary>3. Can corroded gas pipes be repaired?</summary>
              <p>
                Minor corrosion may be repairable, but extensive deterioration
                often requires pipe replacement. A licensed inspection
                determines the safest and most cost-effective solution.

              <summary>4. What causes gas pressure problems?</summary>
              <p>
                Gas pressure issues may result from faulty regulators, pipe
                restrictions, leaks, damaged valves, or undersized piping.
                Professional testing identifies the exact cause.

                5. Is commercial gas line replacement expensive?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Costs vary based on building size, accessibility, pipe
                materials, and code requirements. Replacing severely damaged
                systems often saves money compared to repeated emergency
                repairs.

              An industrial dry chemical fire suppression system is a
              specialized fire protection solution designed to detect and
              suppress fires using dry chemical agents. These systems are
              commonly installed in manufacturing facilities, warehouses, fuel
              storage areas, industrial plants, and high-risk commercial
              environments.

        Detroit experiences some of the most challenging weather conditions in
        the Midwest. From freezing winters and heavy snowfall to humid summers
        and sudden temperature swings, local weather can put significant stress
        on your heating and cooling system. <br />
        Detroit weather directly affects HVAC efficiency, energy consumption,
        equipment lifespan, and indoor comfort. Extreme cold forces furnaces to
        work harder, while hot and humid summers increase the workload on air
        conditioners. Without proper maintenance, these seasonal demands can
        lead to higher utility bills, unexpected breakdowns, and costly repairs.
        <br />
        If you own a home or business in Detroit, understanding how local
        weather impacts your HVAC system can help you improve efficiency, reduce
        costs, and extend the life of your equipment.{" "}

              <strong>Direct Answer:</strong> Detroit winters place heavy
              demands on furnaces, boilers, heat pumps, and ventilation systems.
              Extended periods of below-freezing temperatures force heating
              equipment to run longer cycles, increasing wear and energy
              consumption.

            Commercial HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning)
            services encompass the design, installation, maintenance, and repair
            of climate control systems in non-residential buildings. Fire
            suppression services include the design, installation, inspection,
            and testing of systems — such as sprinklers, gaseous agents, and
            foam systems — that automatically control or extinguish fires.
            Together, they form the backbone of building safety and occupant
            comfort.
            <br />
            Unlike residential systems, commercial HVAC units handle far greater
            loads, operate continuously, and must meet stricter regulatory
            standards set by ASHRAE, NFPA, and local Detroit and Michigan
            building codes. Fire suppression systems are governed by NFPA 13,
            NFPA 72, and the Michigan Mechanical Code — all enforced by local
            fire marshals and the City of Detroit Buildings, Safety Engineering,
            and Environmental Department (BSEED).

            Detroit&apos;s climate is demanding. With summer humidity reaching
            80%+ and winter temperatures dropping well below freezing,
            commercial HVAC systems in Detroit face intense seasonal stress.
            That means a generic installation or a contractor unfamiliar with
            Michigan&apos;s climate patterns will cost you more in energy waste
            and emergency repairs over time.
            <br />
            Beyond climate, Detroit&apos;s commercial real estate landscape
            includes a high concentration of aging industrial buildings, many of
            which require custom HVAC retrofits and fire suppression upgrades to
            meet current codes. The Detroit area is also home to sectors with
            specialized needs:

            Detroit commercial properties use a wide range of HVAC systems
            depending on building size, energy requirements, and property type.
            <br />
            <strong>Rooftop Units (RTUs)</strong>
            <br />
            The most common commercial HVAC solution in Detroit&apos;s retail
            and mid-size commercial buildings. RTUs provide packaged heating and
            cooling and are ideal for flat-roof structures along major corridors
            such as Gratiot Avenue, Michigan Avenue, and Grand River Avenue.
            <br />
            <strong>Chiller & Cooling Tower Systems</strong>
            <br />
            Large office towers, hospitals, and university facilities near Wayne
            State University and the Detroit Medical Center commonly rely on
            central chiller plants for efficient large-scale cooling. Proper
            sizing and routine maintenance are essential for performance and
            reliability.
            <br />
            <strong>Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) Systems</strong>
            <br />
            VRF systems are increasingly popular in Detroit&apos;s mixed-use
            developments and historic building renovations where traditional
            ductwork is difficult to install. They provide zone-by-zone
            temperature control and excellent energy efficiency.
            <br />
            <strong>Split Systems & Heat Pumps</strong>
            <br />
            Smaller office spaces and commercial suites in Midtown and New
            Center frequently use split systems and heat pumps. Modern
            commercial heat pumps can operate efficiently during Michigan
            winters when paired with supplemental heating systems.

              <p className="text-white leading-relaxed">
                Commercial gas piping installation costs in Detroit depend on
                building size, gas load requirements, piping material, permit
                fees, labor complexity, and code compliance upgrades. Older
                Detroit commercial properties often require additional
                retrofitting, pressure testing, or ventilation modifications
                that can increase total project costs.

              </li>

              <li>
                The type of commercial gas system being installed impacts
                material, pressure regulation, and equipment requirements.
              </li>

              <li>
                Material selection such as black steel, CSST, or specialty
                piping changes both labor and long-term maintenance costs.
              </li>

              <li>
                Detroit permit fees, inspections, and compliance with Michigan
                codes add to total project expenses.
              </li>

              <li>
                Older commercial buildings may require structural upgrades,
                ventilation improvements, or replacement of outdated

            system was replaced with four high-efficiency RTUs (Carrier 48XP
            series, 25-ton each) with BACnet-compatible controls for remote
            monitoring. Simultaneously, the aging dry-pipe sprinkler system —

                  A qualified commercial HVAC contractor in Detroit should hold
                  a Michigan Mechanical Contractor License (issued by LARA), EPA
                  Section 608 certification for refrigerant handling, and
                  ideally NATE (North American Technician Excellence)
                  certification for technicians. For larger projects, look for
                  ASHRAE-certified professionals who can perform energy modeling

                  Under NFPA 25 and Michigan state law, wet-pipe sprinkler
                  systems must receive a quarterly visual inspection, an annual
                  internal inspection, and a full five-year obstruction
                  investigation. Alarm and detection systems require annual
                  testing per NFPA 72. Kitchen hood suppression systems (Ansul)
                  must be inspected every six months. Failure to maintain
                  inspection records can result in insurance coverage denial and
                  code violations.

                <p className="mt-2">
                  A fire alarm system detects smoke, heat, or carbon monoxide
                  and alerts occupants and the fire department — but does not
                  extinguish the fire. A fire suppression system actively
                  releases a suppression agent (water, gas, foam, or chemical)
                  to control or extinguish a fire automatically. Most commercial
                  buildings in Detroit require both systems, integrated so that
                  the suppression system triggers upon alarm activation. This
                  integration is governed by NFPA 72 and NFPA 13.

                  Timeline depends on system type and building complexity. A
                  single RTU replacement typically takes 1–3 days including
                  crane setup and commissioning. A full chiller plant
                  replacement or VRF multi-zone system can take 4–12 weeks,
                  especially when Detroit BSEED mechanical permits are required.
                  Factor in 2–6 weeks for permit approval before any work
                  begins. A good contractor will manage the permit process on
                  your behalf and provide a detailed project schedule upfront.

          <>
            A kitchen exhaust hood is installed above cooking equipment such as
            stoves, grills, fryers, and ovens. Its main purpose is to remove
            smoke and steam, control excess heat and moisture, capture grease
            particles, and eliminate cooking odors. The system pulls
            contaminated air through filters and ductwork Vand releases it
            safely outside.

            Proper ventilation improves fire safety and ensures code compliance.
            Grease buildup is a major fire hazard, and a well-designed exhaust
            system helps meet NFPA and local fire codes. It also improves air
            quality, prevents smoke-filled kitchens, keeps temperatures cooler,
            and helps restaurants pass health inspections without penalties.

            Type I exhaust hoods are designed for heavy-duty cooking equipment
            that produces grease and smoke, such as fryers, grills,
            charbroilers, and woks. These are required for most restaurants.
            Type II exhaust hoods are used for heat and steam with minimal
            grease, such as dishwashers, ovens, and steamers.
